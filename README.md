### Values
I'm really into the craftsmanship side of building software. I love reading about software development, particularly about the things that don't change from decade to decade.

### Favorite Software Books
- Code Complete (Steve McConnell)
- Refactoring (Martin Fowler)
- The Pragmatic Programmer (Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas)
- Extreme Programming Explained (Beck, Andress)
- The Mythical Man Month (Brooks)
- Design Patterns (Gang of Four)
